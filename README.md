### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm LummiGhost. (Double 'm' because "LumiGhost" is already used.)

I'm a software developer who enjoys coding in my spare time. I recently graduated and am constantly learning new skills to improve my craft. The projects you find here are purely side projects, so updates might not be as frequent, as I work on them when inspiration strikes.

I recently changed my GitHub username from EadderYin to LummiGhost, as a way to motivate myself to leave behind my old habits and embrace a more disciplined approach to my work.

I'm driven by my interests, and my ultimate dream is to achieve financial freedom.

### Recent Activities

- Updated my GitHub username to LummiGhost to reflect my commitment to personal growth and productivity.

### Motto

**keep it, keep up.**

*(Inspired by the game "Death Stranding")*
